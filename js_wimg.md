js\_wimg provides support for the Windows Imaging API to nJord. It requires the wimgapi.dll redistributable to function, and is statically linked to it. It exposes the [WIMCreateFile](WIMCreateFile.md) function for creating and opening WIM files, and the [WIMFile](WIMFile.md) and [WIMImage](WIMImage.md) classes for manipulating the files and images returned by [WIMCreateFile](WIMCreateFile.md).
