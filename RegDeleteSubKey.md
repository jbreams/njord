DeleteSubKey will recursively remove a subkey from a loaded [RegKey](RegKey.md). If the call succeeds, the subkey, all its values, and all its children will be removed. The function will return true on success and false on failure. More information about the failure can be retrieved using [GetLastError](GetLastError.md). The function takes one argument which is the name of the key to be deleted.
