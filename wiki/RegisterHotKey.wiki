RegisterHotKey will register a hotkey with the hotkey thread and create the hotkey thread if necessary.

==Parameters==
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| Keycode || String || The character you want to register as a hotkey. Only the first character in the string passed will be used. ||
|| Flags || UInt16 || Flags that specify whether control, alt, and/or shift should be held down before firing this keycode. ||
|| Function || String || The name of the JavaScript function to call when the hotkey is fired. ||

==Return code==
If the function succeeds, it will return the id number of the hotkey that was registered. Otherwise, it will return false.

==Remarks==
This function is synchronous, in that it won't return until the hotkey thread has actually registered the hotkey. The numeric value of the hotkey can be passed to [UnregisterHotKey].
