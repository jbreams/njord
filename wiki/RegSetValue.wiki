SetValue will set a value on a registry key. If the value did not exist, it is created; otherwise, it is overwritten.

==Parameters==
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| Name || String || The name of the value to set ||
|| Value || Varies || The value to set, depends on the type of value ||
|| Type || UInt32 || A constant that tells what type of value to set ||

==Return value==

The function returns true on success and false on failure, more information can be retrieved using [GetLastError].

==Remarks==

SetValue tries to determine what kind of value you want to set by the type of JavaScript value is passed. For example, if you want to set a REG_SZ (single null-terminated string), you need only send a string to the function, or if you want REG_DWORD (unsigned long), you need only pass an integer. The function will accept the following types to registry values.

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
|| REG_DWORD || An unsigned 32-bit integer ||
|| REG_SZ || A null-terminated string ||
|| REG_EXPAND_SZ || A null-terminated string with environment variables ||
|| REG_MULTI_SZ || An array of null-terminated strings ||

If no suitable conversion is found, the function will convert it to a REG_SZ. For REG_EXPAND_SZ, you must specify type parameter. For REG_MULTI_SZ, you must pass an array of values - they will all be converted into strings.
