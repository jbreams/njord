LoadImage will load an image from a [WIMFile] and returns it as a [WIMImage] object. It takes a single parameter, the number of the image you want to load. It will return a [WIMImage] object on success and returns false on failure, [GetLastError] can be used to get more information about an error. You should call [WIMSetTemporaryPath SetTemporaryPath] on the [WIMFile] with the image before calling this function, otherwise it will fail.
