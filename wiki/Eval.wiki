Eval will take an arbitrary string and run it as JavaScript code, optionally in another thread.

==Parameters==
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| theScript || String || The code to evaluate ||
|| async || Boolean || Whether to run in a separate thread (defaults to false) ||

==Return Value==
If the script is evaluated asyncronously, this function will return nothing. Otherwise it will return the value return value of the script evaluated. If the script doesn't return a value, it will return nothing.

==Remarks==
The function will evaluate a string as code in the same global object as the caller but in a separate context if called asynchronously. In both asynchronous and synchronous mode, the evaluated code will share all the variables with the calling context.
