MD5 will take any arbitrary javascript value and produce an MD5 hash of it as a hexadecimal-encoded string. The function takes one parameter, the value to hash. It returns the hash as a string or false on an error. Internally, it converts any value passed to it into a string and hashes the unicode characters of that string, not including the terminating null character. The function uses the Windows Cryptography API for hashing and has no dependencies.
