js_curl provides a binding for the cURL libraries for URL handling. A cURL request is encapsulated in the Curl class. 

==Methods==

 *  [Curl.SetOpt SetOpt] - Sets cURL options on the cURL easy session encapsulated by the class.
 *  [Curl.Perform Perform] - Performs the cURL session and returns the results as a string.
 *  [Curl.SaveAs SaveAs] - Same as [Perform], but saves the returned content as a file rather than return it as a string.

==Remarks==

The session is cleaned up automatically when the object is finalized.
