The nJord Platform exposes functionality for editing the Windows registry. The majority of the work for editing the registry is done using the [RegKey] class. The [RegKey] class can be created either by using the [RegOpenKey] or [RegCreateKey] functions. It provides all the functionality required for manipulating values and subkeys. Additionally, there are global functions for manipulating hives and keys:

 * [RegLoadHive]
 * [RegUnloadHive]
 * [RegDeleteKey]
