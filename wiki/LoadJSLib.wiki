LoadJSLib will load a JavaScript file, with signing if it is configured, and execute it in the caller's context and thread. The function does this synchronously and the executed script shares the same global object as the caller, so any functions or variables that were defined in the loaded script  at the global scope will be loaded into the global scope when the function returns. This can be used to load external libraries into a script at runtime. The function will return true on success or false on failure. More information about the failure can be retrieved with [GetLastError].
