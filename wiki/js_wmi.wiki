JS_WMI exposes read-only access into the Windows Management Instrumentation for querying properties about the system. It wraps up several of the COM objects from the WMI C++ API, and requires the computer not to be in setup mode. 

The module exposes one function for creating an object that represents a single WMI namespace, [WbemConnect].  The module creates the WbemLocator when it is loaded. It exposes classes to access the WMI namespaces.

==Classes==
|| *Name* || *Description* ||
|| [WbemServices] || Encapsulates a single WMI namespace and the functions that can be performed on it. ||
|| [WbemEnumerator] || An enumerator for results of queries. ||
|| [WbemClass] || Encapsulates a single instance or definition of a WMI class. ||

All objects are cleaned up automatically when they fall out of scope.
