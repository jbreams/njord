ApplyImage will apply a loaded [WIMImage] to a local filesystem. It takes two parameters, the first is the path where the image should be applied (eg. "C:\\"), and the second is a flags parameter that will control how the files are restored. When the image has been applied, the function will flush the file buffers on the target filesystem to prevent data corruption if the computer is suddenly turned off.
