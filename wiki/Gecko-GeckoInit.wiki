GeckoInit will load the GRE into memory and start the Gecko UI thread that will handles messages and creation of all browser windows. It takes a single optional parameter, which is the full path to the xpcom.dll for the GRE you want to use. If you are using Mozilla FireFox as the GRE, you would call this as `GeckoInit("c:\\Program Files\\Mozilla FireFox\\xpcom.dll");` The function is synchronous and won't return until the GRE has been loaded and initialized and the UI thread is ready to begin receiving requests for creating new browser windows. If the load succeeds, it will return true, otherwise it will return false.
