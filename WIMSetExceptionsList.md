SetExceptionsList will set the list of exceptions to be used during image capture. It takes a single parameter, an array of exact or wild-card paths and filenames to be excluded. It is recommended that you call this before image capture to prevent capturing System Volume Information or the Recycler or temporary files into the image. It will accept both the '**' wild card which will match any number of characters or the '?' wildcard to match a single character. You could for example pass "c:\\Documents and Settings\\**\\My Documents" to exclude the my documents folder of every user on the image source. If there is no back-slash in the string, it will assume that you're matching against a filename, otherwise it assumes you're matching against an absolute path from the root of the image capture.
