LoadImage will load an image from a [WIMFile](WIMFile.md) and returns it as a [WIMImage](WIMImage.md) object. It takes a single parameter, the number of the image you want to load. It will return a [WIMImage](WIMImage.md) object on success and returns false on failure, [GetLastError](GetLastError.md) can be used to get more information about an error. You should call [SetTemporaryPath](WIMSetTemporaryPath.md) on the [WIMFile](WIMFile.md) with the image before calling this function, otherwise it will fail.
