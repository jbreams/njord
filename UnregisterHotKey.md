UnregisterHotKey will unregister a hotkey from the hotkey thread. It takes one parameter, the ID number of the hotkey that is to be removed (see [RegisterHotKey](RegisterHotKey.md)). It will return true on success and false on failure. When you unregister the last hotkey, the function will shutdown the hotkey thread.
